    },
    {
        question: "Myth: I will feel weak and tired after donating blood.",
        answer: "Fact: Most donors feel fine after resting for a short period and having refreshments. Your body replaces the donated blood volume within 24-48 hours. It's important to be well-hydrated before donating."
    },
    {
        question: "Myth: I can't donate because I have high blood pressure or diabetes.",
        answer: "Fact: You can donate blood if your blood pressure is under control (below 180/100 mmHg) at the time of donation. Diabetics can also donate if their condition is managed through diet or oral medication, and their blood sugar is under control."
    },
    {
        question: "Myth: Donating blood can lead to infections like HIV.",
        answer: "Fact: This is impossible. A brand new, sterile, single-use needle is used for every donor and is properly discarded afterward. There is no risk of contracting any blood-borne disease."
